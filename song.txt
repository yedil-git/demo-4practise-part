Bring IT On 
Quest
Part 2

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you're alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around to show you how

[Chorus]
She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been

[Verse 2]
The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
An' it takes a song to come around to show you how

[Chorus]
She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
Than I've ever been
